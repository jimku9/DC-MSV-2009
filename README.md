This code implements [Dynamic Correlation Multivariate Stochastic Volatility of Asai and McAleer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407608002170), with the purpose to show that, when conducting simulation-based study (such as MCMC), the random Wishart matrices generated with integer-valued or fractional degrees of freedom can lead to very different results. 

Details are given in the article [On the degrees of freedom in MCMC-based Wishart models for time series data](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271602572_On_the_degrees_of_freedom_in_MCMC-based_Wishart_models_for_time_series_data).
